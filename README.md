#  Connector Tools

`Connector-tools` contain projects required to build a `Kyma`connector bundle. It is meant to be used for connecting an application to kyma having no built-in Kyma pairing logic provided.

The repository does not contain the actual bundle definition, it is providing the source code for the different tools only.
Samples for actual bundles will be provided soon.
